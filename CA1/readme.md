# Assignment 1: Color representations
**Task:**
**(a)** Find and discuss the RGB representation of a true white object (reflectance unity for all
wavelengths) captured by the above spectral tristimulus system under the 3 different
illuminants stated.
**(b)** Considering the uniform illumination spectra and the object reflectance as ρ(λ) = w(λ)
maxλ w(λ)
with w ∈ {x, y, z}, find and discuss the RGB representations of the object captured by the
above spectral tristimulus system for all the 3 object reflectances.
